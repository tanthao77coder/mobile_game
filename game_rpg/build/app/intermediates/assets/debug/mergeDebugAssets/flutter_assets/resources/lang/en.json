  "talk_wizard_2": "Hmm...\nI don't want to discourage you, but you are the fifth knight sent on this mission. So far, none have returned alive, and their bodies hang on the walls as trophies.",
  "talk_player_2": "Don't worry, old man. A knight like me has never existed before!\nI will destroy all the creatures here and rescue the child!",
  "talk_wizard_3": "Well, confidence is certainly not something you lack!\nDon't say I didn't warn you!\nGood luck!",

  "talk_boss3_1": "Shut up, you lowly creatures!\nHow dare you disrupt my plans? You shall pay the price!",
  "talk_player_9": "You disgusting creature!\nIt's time to send you back to hell!",
  "talk_boss3_2": "Look at these fake heroes! My power will crush you!\nCome here!",
  "talk_kid_10": "That was a tough battle,\nbut we won!",
  "talk_kid_11": "The Demon King has been defeated! The other monsters will soon disappear.\nThank you for saving the kingdom!",
